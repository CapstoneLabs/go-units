# go-units

Go library for manipulating and converting between various units of measurement.

## Fork

This fork is used to customize the great library [bcicen/go-units](https://github.com/bcicen/go-units) more according to our needs. We have therefore planned, but not definitely, not to merge the fork back into the base, but rather to maintain an abstraction of it here.

## Usage

For a full usage documentation of the original library please look [here](https://github.com/bcicen/go-units#readme=).
